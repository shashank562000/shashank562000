# 👋 Hey there, I'm **Shashank Rai**

I’m a passionate **Backend Engineer** who thrives on architecting reliable, scalable, and AI-integrated systems. With deep hands-on experience in designing complex backend solutions, I build APIs that don't just serve — they **scale, secure, and evolve**.

## 🚀 About Me

🔧 I specialize in **backend architecture**, **API development**, and **AI-integrated systems** using modern JavaScript/TypeScript stacks.

💼 Over the years, I've engineered robust backend systems across diverse domains:

- 🛒 **E-Commerce Platform** – handled full backend including products, orders, cart, payments, user management, and admin dashboards
- 🏥 **Hospital Management System** – appointment flow, patient-doctor modules, secure health records, and billing
- 🎟️ **Ticket Booking App** – built scalable ticketing logic with real-time availability and notifications
- 🔁 **Onsfer Platform** – implemented push notifications, user messaging, real-time updates, and background workers
- 🎉 **Event Management System** – multi-role access, ticketing, QR scanning, and event analytics
- 🧾 **iDocx: AI-powered OCR System** – used **DeepSeek-VL2**, **Gemini Pro**, **GPT-4 Vision**, and **Textract** for intelligent document parsing

🧠 I’m obsessed with integrating **LLMs and OCR engines** with backend systems — turning raw documents and images into structured, searchable insights.
